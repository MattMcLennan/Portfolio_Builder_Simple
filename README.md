    Weekend project:

    Application allows users to insert their chosen stocks and build 
    a portfolio to analyze market statistics, including average valuation ratios, average financial ratios, marketcap exposure and sector exposure.

    For simplicity reasons, it assumes equal weighting for stock positions.

    Users must enter into the search bar the following format:
        exchange: stock, exhange:stock, etc. 

    The following below is an example of correct search completed:
    TSX:RY,TSX:TD,TSX:BNS,TSX:CNR,TSX:SU,TSX:BMO,TSX:BCE,TSX:ENB,TSX:MFC,TSX:CM, TSX:ABH,TSX:AUR, TSX:AXU, NYSE:BMC, NYSE:STV, NYSE:RHT, NYSE:COL, NYSE:TNE, NYSE:HAS, NYSE:FRO, NYSE:DDR

    
    The following below is an example of a search that will show an error as TSX:BBY is not a valid ticker on the TSX:
    TSX:RY,TSX:TD,TSX:BNS,TSX:CNR,TSX:SU,TSX:BMO,TSX:BCE,TSX:ENB,TSX:MFC,TSX:CM, TSX:BBY
